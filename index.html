                            <p class="lead box about">Adaptable and hungry for knowledge, I’m a full stack web developer looking to showcase my technical skills and establish myself as a junior developer. I love challenges and whether it was taking all the academics I could in highschool, working in different fields of construction, or coaching junior basketball, I’ve always been highly committed to what I do and have excelled in these areas because of it. I’m normally considered quiet at first but I work great in teams and I always make sure everyone can be heard. I’m a quick learner and problem solving and puzzles has always been something I could have fun with. Acquiring a certificate in full stack web development from UofT SCS has been just that. I gain a lot of satisfaction creating applications and once it’s done I want to keep improving it. I have many different applications demonstrating my understanding of both front end and back end technologies which you can see in my portfolio section.</p>
                            <!-- <p class="lead box about">I'm Nathan Polomark and I'm from Chilliwack, B.C.  My hobbies are video games, music, and sports. I have jumped into full stack web development in hopes of a happier life. My previous work was in different fields of construction. I spent the most amount of time in framing, which was four years with the same company. I'm glad to be out of it but I will never regret learning what I did. I've gained many transferable skills like teaching others, troubleshooting problems, and having confidence to figure things out on my own.</p> -->
