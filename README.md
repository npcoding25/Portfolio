## Description

A small webpage where you can get everything you need to know about me.

## Functionality

When you open the webpage you'll see a short description of myself. From the navbar you can go to two other pages. The contact page is where you can find all the ways to contact me personally. The portfolio page contains the projects I've done or have done with a team. There is a screenshot, description and two links for each project. One is to use the application and the other takes you to my repo for that project.

## Challenges/Improvements

This assignment wasn't too challenging. The hardest thing for me is writing about myself and starting a resume. I've never made a resume for this field of work so I didn't really know where to start. As I progress through this bootcamp I'll be adding more projects and highlighting my better ones.
